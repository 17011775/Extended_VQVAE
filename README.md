# Extended_VQVAE
This is a Pytorch implementation of extended VQVAE mentioned in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07884).

We introduce an important extension to VQ-VAE for learning F0-related suprasegmental information simultaneously along with traditional phone features. The proposed framework uses two encoders such that the F0 trajectory and speech waveform are both input to the system, therefore two separate codebooks are learned. 

![Framework of extended VQVAE](https://github.com/nii-yamagishilab/Extended_VQVAE/blob/master/framework.png?raw=true)

We reconstructed the speech using both [original VQVAE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00937) and extended VQVAE with [F0 encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07884). 

In brief, we have done:

1. Extend the original VQ-VAE with an F0 encoder.
2. Extend the global condition to speaker code, gender code, and emotion code. 
3. Trained a model with multi-speaker & multi-emotional Japanese corpus.
4. Trained a model with a public Chinese corpus.

To do:
1. Testing on voice conversion
2. Testing on emotions' conversion

Please find our samples [here](https://nii-yamagishilab.github.io/yi-demo/interspeech-2020/index.html).

# Usage
./run.sh    
(will add more information here)

# Trained models
We can provide trained models for only research purpose.  We have trained models for both original VQVAE and extended VQVAE. Please contact the zhaoyi[email mark]nii.ac.jp if you want to get either Japanese or Chinese trained models.
